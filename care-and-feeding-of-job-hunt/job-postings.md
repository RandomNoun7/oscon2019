# Job Postings

## What to expect

They are really really bad. Rubbish. Terrible.

- Vague
- Mythical Requirements
- Specific but excessive Requirements

### Why does this happen

- Unclear hiring goal
- Poor requirements gathering
- Poor focus

### Result

Unrealistic and impractical postings

"Requirements" are actually "Nice To Haves"

If you see a job that you are interested in, and you have a general interest and
familiarity, apply. Full stop. Just apply.

Don't do the managers job for them. Let the manager do the work of deciding who
will be good for the role.

### Where to look for job postings

Indeed.com has gotten good and they're nice people.
craigslist can be very regional. Can be good in SV, not in Portland.
Monster is old school, but things are there.
Stack overflow careers has gotten good, but a lot of startups.

Linked in surprisingly great for this. Presentor uses it, but doesn't "like" it.
But for jobs, it's great! And if you're willing to pay you can get additional
access. But even without it you can get a lot of great job leads. A lot of these
will be more mature companies.

Field specific job boards like government, ad tech, healthcare, etc job boards.

Job hunt is a "Full-Time" job but try to only do it for a half day or something
like that. Don't burn yourself out.

Most of the jobs are NOT IN TECH COMPANIES! There are IT, tech, programming jobs
in all of the other industries. Don't limit yourself to tech.

#### Less obvious places

Products and services you enjoy
Conference Sponsors
Conferences themselves
Industry news sites
Sponsors on non-profits you support

When a company gets a new big round of funding, they are going to hire like
crazy!

### Networking

- Social Networking (twitter, etc)
- Hallway track at Conferences
- Recruiters
- Folks you know

Recruiters:
There are some good recruiters. Engage, be polite and respectful. Some of them
are genuinely interested in getting the right people in the right jobs. If they
ping you about something you're not interested in, maybe let them know what you
ARE interested in.
