# Inerviewing

# All advice

- Research!
  Refresh your memory.
  Research typical salary for that role in the geo area it's based.
- Dress comfortably but well, even for phone interviews.
  It makes a huge difference to your state of mind.
- Ask about the dress code. For phone interview maybe not, but if remote video
  interview, it applies. Make sure whatever you wear, make sure it feels well
  and makes you feel comfortable and well. Don't wear shoes that are too tight
  or itchy fabrics, or new, daring outfits you might not like when the time comes.
  Be neat, be tidy, be put together.
- Prepare questions
  When the interviewer asks if you have questions, do not say no. Have some
  questions to ask. Have at least five prepared, but don't necessarily expect
  you'll have time to ask all of them.
- Don't always just wait until the end to ask questions.
  This is a conversation. You can ask questions as a part of the conversation.
  Don't let the inteview happen to you. Be a part of it.
- It's ok to say I don't know.
  If you do have to say this, the very next thing is to explain how you might
  go about figuring it out.
- Be on time.
  On time is five minutes early.
  You will be on time. Show up 30 minutes early and sit in the parking lot if
  that's what it takes.
- Take notes
  Who did you speak with, what was talked about, research to be done.

## Phone Screen

- Typically HR or a recruiter
- Purpose
  Do you meet even the lowest possible bar.
- Common questions
  - Will you relocate?
  - Why are you leaving your current position? DO NOT BAD MOUTH YOUR CURRENT JOB.
  - What is your current salary? THIS IS BAD. DO NOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION.
    It could be illegal, maybe not, but it's just not relevant here at this point.
    What they are looking for is, are you out of their budget. That is a valid
    thing for them to want to know, but not what you currently make.
    "According to my research, this role can pay anywhere from x to y, and I would
    be comfortable with anything in that range."

## Phone Interview

- More advanced than a phone screen.
- The start of the real interview.
- Review research, review notes, review the cover letter and resume you sent them.
  Research the interviewer.

## Onsite

- Plan ahead. Plan out the route. What is a backup route in case something happens.
- Have you ever actually tried to get there? Try it out if you can. Figure out
  the parking if you need to. Do you know if you need to or not? Figure it out.
- Leave early and arrive early.
- Be nice to EVERYONE! Including front desk people.
- Eat beforehand. Hunger is distracting
- Send a thank you email the next day. Don't send snail mail, just an email.
- A followup email can be a good place for followup questions. Keeps them engaged.
- Let them know if you liked them, or NOT!
