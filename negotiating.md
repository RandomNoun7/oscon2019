# Negotiating

Always assume you will be negotiating.

Please negotiate. As a hiring manager, I expect it.

There's not just salary. Are you walking away from a yearly bonus? Get it as a
signing bonus.

Negotiate for PTO, conference time, relocation.

## Negotiating for salary

- Negotiate in good faith.
  Niether side should feel they are being exploited.
- Refresh your salary research. You might have done your salary research a
  while ago.
- Data, not feelings.
  If they data doesn't support it, don't negotiate for it. You are in a much
  stronger position if everything you assert is backed up by data.
- You need to prove your worth
  Don't just demand something. Prove you are worth something extra if you're
  asking for it.
- Only ever negotiate over email. Get everything in writing. At least if you
  have to, send a followup email to corroborate negotiated items in writing.
- How to present yourself
  - Polite
  - Respectful
  - Excited
  - No ultimatums
- Know what you will not accept, and then do not accept it.
  If you need anthing you can get, do what you gotta do, but don't sell yourself
  short if you have the option.

### Q and A

- What about the opportunity to up negotiation later?
  Get it in writing that you will re negotiate in six months or whatever later.
  When does the company look at salaries and performance reviews? If it's too
  long negotiate for it during this time.
- What about multiple offers and timelines?
  It's good problem to have, but still a problem.
  It's ok to tell a company you're waiting that you have an offer on the table
  now that wants an answer right now.
  They probably do want the chance to respond.
  "I need until this date for another company to get back to me. I like both of
  you and I would like to give them a chance to respond."
  If they say no, you need to respond right now, they are pressuring you. That's
  a bad sign. If you can, walk. They are already treating you badly and they
  haven't even hired you yet.
  Don't play people against eachother. Assume good faith when you can.
