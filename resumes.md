## Do not do these

- Objective
  I don't care. I care about my problems and I need someone to help me do
  that.
- References available upon request
  I already know this. It's obvious. Get rid of it.
- References
  It's presumptuous. Don't assume I'm going to need this information. We won't
  need it until the very very end.
- Photo
  Don't do this in United States. Some managers will discriminate, consciously
  or not, based on what you look like. Don't give them the chance. It's
  illegal to do, impossible to prove.
- Hobbies, clubs, etc.
  Do not include things that don't have anything to do with your career. It
  allows people to discriminate against you for unrelated reasons. Don't mix
  work and non-work.
- Fancy desgins or colors
  Just don't. It's distracting. It's hard to skim. If you make it hard for me
  to scan your resume it's going right in the bin.
  You have three audiences. The HR recruiter, the hiring manager and the team,
  and then there's the automatic document parser. Companies use online, automated
  systems to slurp up resume's based on key words. Fancy resume's are hard to
  parse and won't get past this.
  At least 8% of your audiences are going to be color blind. Just use black and
  white.
- Ratings of your skills
  You are your own worst critic. Don't do this to yourself. Your three could be
  the hiring manager's four.
- Truthiness
  Do not stretch the truth, or of course lie. Be truthful. You don't have to
  include anything that makes you look bad, but you cannot lie or stretch.

## What to include

- Professional information that shows what you can do and the DIFFERENCE YOU CAN
MAKE DOING IT.
- Provable results and numbers.
  I led a team of x number of developers and saved y amount of time per customer
  and saved z amount of money for the company.
  If you don't have numbers now, start collecting them.
  Numbers pop out in a resume.
- Professional affiliations, awards, and accreditation's.
  Cherry pick if need be to list the most relevant for the job posting.
- Tech
  An easy to parse list of the tech you know. Re-organize the list to push
  the buttons for the job you're applying for right now. Do not rate your
  abilities in any of these. That's "my job".

## Do these things

- Put the things I'm looking for right at the top.
  Manipulate me. Give me the things I want to see.
- Use Trello to track your job search
  Attach the saved job posting pdf and attach it to the card.
- Ask references if you can use them specifically for each job
  Protects their privacy

## Format

There is no one right way to format a resume. Full stop.

### Guidelines

- Keep it simple
  Automated parsers, recruiters, etc.
- Most popular is chronological.
  List jobs, most recent first
- Functional
  Common, but some managers don't like it.
  List of skills rather than experience.
  Employment history and education at the end
  Some managers think it hides gaps in employment history. She hates this because
  a gap in employment history should not really be a negative. If you have a gap
  it's none of the recruiters damn business why you have a gap. It could be for
  a lot of very valid reasons.
- Make it easy to skim
  Format so that it's easy to see the relevant information for the position I
  am trying to fill.
- Maintain multiple versions of your resume.
  Feel free to use several. Not just in format. Multiple versions of the content
  as well.
- Maintain at least 3 versions
  - LOOOOOOOOONG
    Incredible amounts of detail. It will almost never be shared.
    Things you've worked on, the projects you were on, the people you helped.
  - General Purpose
    The one you put on your website. Not targeted, no contact info.
  - Specific and targeted
    For every single job you apply to, provide a specific and targeted resume.
    Bump experience of verbiage related to a particular job, to the top of that
    targeted resume.
    If you don't have time or energy to get really specifically targeted, just
    send the thing out.
- Use the space you need
  Advice to use one page was back from when all resume's were mailed in on paper
  Try not to exceed three printed pages, but sometimes it just takes more than
  page to get things in.
  You don't need to include the kitchen sink, but two pages is ok. But if it's
  relevant put it in there.
- When do you update
  Constantly. Not when you need a new job fast and you're stressed. It should
  be ready to go for the most part when you need it. She has a repeating task
  each month to update her long resume. She doesn't always do it, but she gets
  the reminder. At least she thinks about it and decides to do it or not do it.
  Do it while you still have access to company systems you might need to gather
  the information you need to update your resume. How many patches you've landed,
  projects and people you've worked with.
- Use git
  git is not just for code. Put your resume and cover letter in there.
  Use a private repo. Don't put it in a public repo and leak your contact info.

### Q and A

- Relevant vs all expeirience
  Always lean toward relevant.
- In layout, is two columns too fancy
  Particularly given resume scanners, parsers etc.
  It depends, if it's easy to skim, using only basic characters etc, go ahead
  and try it. But, some will simply not deal with it well. It's a risk.
- If I have hobbies or volunteer experience can I put that in.
  If it's relevent to the job or the field, absolutely yes.
  If it's politcal, don't emphasize the political side, just point to the website
  you helped to build because it's nice and you helped build it.
- What should a college student with little or no expeirence do
  I can almost guarentee you don't have no expeirience at all. What you have is
  course work, group projects, internships, etc. If you don't have anything at
  all that's relevent, why are you applying for this job, or we can start looking
  for relevent paid internships.
- What is easy to skim
  Going to have nothing in great big blocks. Try to have plenty of space between
  words. Don't go bolding shit for me. I'll decide what's important. If you don't
  know for sure, just hand it to someone. They don't need to know what you do for
  a living, maybe better if they don't. They should be able to tell based on
  skimming your resume.
- Linked in asks for a photo should I put one?
  I hate that Linkedin in asks for a photo. It feeds biases, but sometimes you
  have to make compromises.
- What do you think of soft skills vs hard skills
  Soft skills are hard! Skills like writing, leading teams, etc, those are soft
  skills but they are skills, put them in there. How do you present it?
  If you're applying for a lead job, present it with everything else. Put them
  in with the job in the experience section, and in with the skills if it's a job
  that needs them.

## Cover Letters

A lot of people in software think they are useless. They are wrong.

### Purposes

- Shows who you are
  Code can she me what you'v done and how.
  A cover letter tells me WHO YOU ARE. I want a sense of who you are. I'm hiring
  people.
- Why you
  Tell me what you as an applicant are going to improve my life and the lives
  of my team members.
- Anticipate questions
  Are you located far away? Tell me if you are willing to relocate or you are
  looking for remote. Why do you have a big experience gap? If there's an
  explanation, explain it here. Address questions briefly and move on. Don't go
  into detail.
- Before you start, do some research.
  Learn about the company, it's products, goals, people that work there. Did they
  just land a series A?
